### INTRODUCTION
####Data is everywhere.
Nowadays, everyone has to deal with mounds of data,
whether they call themselves "data analysts" or not.
But people who possess a toolbox of data analysis skills
have a **massive edge** on everyone else, because they understand what to ***do*** with all that stuff. They know how to translate raw numbers into intelligence that **drives real-world action**. They know how to **break down and structure** complex problems and data sets to get right to the heart of the problems in their business.
