### INTRODUCTION
####Data is everywhere.
Nowadays, everyone has to deal with mounds of data.People who possess a toolbox of data analysis skills have a **massive edge** on everyone else, because they understand what to ***do*** with all that stuff. They know how to translate raw numbers into intelligence that **drives real-world action**. They know how to **break down and structure** complex problems and data sets to get right to the heart of the problems in their business.

### Use Case
Affordable food prices are essential to maintaining good nutrition in a population. Local market price swings are frequently reported in the news. 

The use case for the labs involves combining a food market price dataset from the United Nations Global World Food Price database with the World Health Organizationâ€™s Number of Ebola Cases and Deaths in Affected Countries dataset. Both datasets have already been downloaded from the **Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)**.

The analysis uses **R** to simultaneously visualize the monthly average price of locally-grown rice in five Guinea retail markets compared with the monthly average cumulative number of confirmed Ebola cases. The goal is to determine if there is a possible **correlation** between the 2014 Ebola outbreak and the price of rice that would justify further research. Prices swings are frequently due to changes in exchange rates and to crop harvest levels. The analysis is intented to be exploratory in nature.
